# What the plugin will and will not do when it writes its own state files.
#
#   bash state-write-safety.test.sh
#
# Needs no Seerr and no credentials -- it calls the state helpers directly.
#
# Marketplace review (2026-09-11) blocked the listing because the state writes
# used a predictable "<file>.tmp" name opened without O_NOFOLLOW or O_EXCL. Any
# process that can write into the state directory could pre-plant that exact
# name as a symlink and have the poll truncate the file it pointed at -- an
# arbitrary-write primitive in whatever account runs the widget.
#
# The three guarantees asserted here:
#   1. a planted symlink at the predictable temp name is never followed
#   2. a state file that is itself a symlink is never read through
#   3. a group- or world-writable state directory is refused outright
# plus a control proving ordinary state still round-trips, so a fix that simply
# stopped writing would fail rather than look like a pass.
#
# Scope note, stated rather than implied: the directory descriptor is opened
# O_NOFOLLOW and owner-checked, and every file operation is relative to that
# descriptor. That closes the final component and the directory itself. A parent
# directory that is already an attacker-owned symlink is outside what a widget
# can defend against and is not claimed here.
