# What the plugin will and will not do when it writes its own state files.
#
#   bash state-write-safety.test.sh
#
# Needs no Seerr and no credentials -- it calls the state helpers directly.
#
# Marketplace review (2026-09-11) blocked the listing because the state writes
# used a predictable "<file>.tmp" name opened without O_NOFOLLOW or O_EXCL. Any
# process that can write into the state directory could pre-plant that exact
# name as a symlink and have the poll truncate the file it pointed at -- an
# arbitrary-write primitive in whatever account runs the widget.
#
# The three guarantees asserted here:
#   1. a planted symlink at the predictable temp name is never followed
#   2. a state file that is itself a symlink is never read through
#   3. a group- or world-writable state directory is refused outright
# plus a control proving ordinary state still round-trips, so a fix that simply
# stopped writing would fail rather than look like a pass.
#
# Marketplace review round 3 (2026-09-22): checking only the final directory
# left its parents open -- a symlink swapped in for ~/.local/state, or any other
# component, would redirect every write. The directory is now reached by walking
# the whole path one component at a time from "/", each opened O_NOFOLLOW
# relative to its parent's descriptor and owner-checked, so:
#   4. a symlink anywhere in the path is refused, not followed
#   5. a parent writable by others (without the sticky bit) is refused
# plus controls proving the normal ~/.local/state path and a sticky /tmp
# ancestor still work.
